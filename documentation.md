+ Provide functionality for managing course information, such as adding new courses, updating course details, and deleting courses.

# Code
+ Stuctures: The project utilizes structures ("Student" and "Course") to encapsulate related data and functions into coherent units.
+ File-Based storage: Data is stored in text files (students.txt and courses.txt) to ensure persistence between program executions.
+ Menu-Driven interface: Interaction with the system is menu-driven, providing users with clear options for various operations.
+ Vectors: Used to store collections of students and courses dynamically, allowing for flexible manipulation and access.

 # Functions
+ Student management functions: Including functions to add, display, update, and delete student records.
+ Course management functions: Similar functions for managing course data.
+ File i/o functions: Functions to read from and write to text files for data persistence.
+ Main function: The central logic of the program, handling user interaction and control flow.
