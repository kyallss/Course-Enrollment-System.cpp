# Course Enrollment System

## 
The purpose of this project is to create a simple Course Enrollment System. It allows users to manage student records and course information, including adding, displaying, updating, and deleting student and course data. The system stores this data in text files for persistence.

####
Stuctures: The project utilizes structures ("Student" and "Course") to encapsulate related data and functions into coherent units.
File-Based storage: Data is stored in text files (students.txt and courses.txt) to ensure persistence between program executions.
Menu-Driven interface: Interaction with the system is menu-driven, providing users with clear options for various operations.
Vectors: Used to store collections of students and courses dynamically, allowing for flexible manipulation and access.

## Functions
Student management functions: Including functions to add, display, update, and delete student records.
Course management functions: Similar functions for managing course data.
File i/o functions: Functions to read from and write to text files for data persistence.
Main function: The central logic of the program, handling user interaction and control flow.

## How to run the program:
Compile the code: Compile the provided C++ code.
Run the executable: Execute the compiled program. Upon running, the user will be presented with a menu of options.
Interact with the menu: Choose an option from the menu by entering the corresponding number.
Follow on-screen prompts: Depending on the chosen option, the user will be prompted to enter additional information (e.g., student ID, course code, etc.).
View results: The system will perform the requested operation and provide feedback on the outcome.
Exit the program: To exit the program, select the "Exit" option from the menu.
